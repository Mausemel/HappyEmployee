# Use Case / Vision:
## Scenario 1
Desktop application to detect employee mood in the office and find a way to cheer them up (show a joke or a funny picture) if they are sad or keep them in a good mood by showing a positive note.

The solution represents a way to keep employees in good mood and also monitor the
level of satisfaction in the office, so that measures can be taken if need and also evaluated. For example, does giving the employees fruits/ chocolate for free have a
positive affect on the team, environment?

## Scenario 2
Extention of sceario 1, where a self moving robot is checking the facial expressions of employees and tries to react appropriately - cheer them up (hug them) or being excited when they seem happy.

## Implemeted prototype:
Detect mood from a photo and based on the result, make the robot react appropriately.

## Prototype limitations:
Development done on MacBook with Python 3.6.2 (for this version the libraries to control the camera are supported only for Windows and Linux) therefore we used only a link to a photo from the internet.
